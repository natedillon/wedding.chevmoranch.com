						<h1>He said...</h1>
						<p>Throughout the prior couple of weeks I was in and out of the jewelry store looking at and deciding on the perfect ring for the perfect girl... But it was that mid-morning on January 19th that I made up my mind that I wanted to propose and to spend the rest of my life with Lindsey. Late afternoon that day we had a meeting at the bank and with the ring burning a hole in my pocket I was very antsy, and wanted to get the meeting over with. After the bank Lindsey want to go home and change but I knew that we needed to get out to our future building site. We rushed out to the land and got there just before sunset. The radio had a good song on it and we danced. After the song I got down on one knee and proposed to Lindsey. The first words she muttered was a “NO,” then another “NO,” with a little scared feeling inside me she finally answered with a “YES, OH YES I WILL.” And that was the beginning of the next chapter in our fairytale life.</p>
